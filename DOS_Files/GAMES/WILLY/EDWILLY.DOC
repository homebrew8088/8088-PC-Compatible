          Uses of the editor:

          The screen editor for Willy the Worm can be  used  to  modify 
          the  eight  screens  used  in  the  game  and  to preview and 
          practice on the higher ones.  If a screen is too hard or  you 
          want to design your own screens entirely, read on.  


          Getting Started:

          To  enter  the  screen  editor,  enter  'EDWILLY'  at the DOS 
          prompt.  Press Enter when asked to do so.  Next you are asked 
          which screen you want to edit.  Answer wth a number from 1 to 
          8.  The screen you choose will then be displayed.


          Editing keys:

          'A' is the help key.  Pressing this key will display a window 
          with a summary of the following instructions.  

          The  arrow  keys  move the cursor (the blinking pixel) around 
          the screen.  Any changes you make will occur at the  location 
          of this cursor.  

          'K'  brings up the prompt for which screen to edit.  Use this 
          to go to another screen.  

          'L' saves all screens on disk for use with the main  program.  
          DO NOT forget to save your work before you leave the program!  

          ';'  copies any screen to any other.  WARNING:  this destroys 
          the screen that is copied over.  

          '.' plays the screen you are currently editing.  The score is 
          included for reference and does not  go  on  the  high  score 
          list.  

          '/'  changes  the starting position to the cursor position on 
          the current screen.  The starting position is represented  by 
          Willy the Worm facing left.  

          ',' enters the small square that produces or  removes  balls.  
          The  topmost  small  square  on  the  screen is automatically 
          chosen to produce balls and all other remove them.  

          'U'  enters  a  vertical  spring at the cursor position.  'I' 
          enters a tack.  'O' enters a section of ladder.  'P' enters a 
          bell.  'J' enters a horizontal spring.  'M' enters a present. 
          
          Various other keys enter sections of wall and floor.  See the 
          help window ('A') for a complete list.  You may want to do a 
          screen dump of the help window if you have a dot matrix 
          printer and the DOS program GRAPHICS. 

          
          Making DONATIONS:

          You've heard it all before: "The development of this software 
          has taken much time and effort.  If we are  to  continue  our 
          production of user-supported software, your contributions are 
          vital."  Well,  I can tell you first-hand that it's true.  If 
          enough people send ten dollars,  maybe I'll  find  it  in  my 
          heart to write "Willy The Worm II" or "Pete the Pigeon".  

          Hint: If you like this game a LOT, you can send more than ten 
          dollars!
          
          Have gobs of fun and don't forget to pass copies on to all of
          your friends!
