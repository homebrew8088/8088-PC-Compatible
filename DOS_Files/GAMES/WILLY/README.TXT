This program, while several years old, is still as interesting
to me as it was when I found it.  Reading the source code told
me something about how programs can be made faster.  This program
is able to accept input *much* faster than the Turbo Pascal 
version 3 routines would allow.  It also shows that Pascal is a
valid language to write games that require fast response.

The games screens are all changeable using the screen editor.
If you have comments or questions about this program, they may
