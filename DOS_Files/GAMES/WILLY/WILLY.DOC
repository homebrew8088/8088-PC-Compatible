          Interesting features:

          Willy the Worm is a fast,  challenging arcade style game with 
          the following special features: 

               *  Fully compatible with IBM PC and PCjr 
               *  Color and sound effects are supported but optional
               *  Not one or two but EIGHT game screens
               *  Editor included for customizing the game screens 
               *  Top ten high scores and names are saved on disk


          Starting the game:

          To start the game,  just enter 'WILLY'  at  the  DOS  prompt.  
          Answer the two questions (color and sound used) with 'Y'  for 
          'Yes' or 'N' for 'No'.  After that,  the title screen will be 
          displayed with some basic instructions.


          Playing the game:

          The object of the game is to reach  the  bell  without  being 
          squashed  by  a  cannonball  or  running  out of time.  Extra 
          points may be earned by getting presents along the way and by 
          jumping over the balls.  After you reach the bell you will be 
          awarded points for the remaining time and you will advance to 
          the next screen.

          The game is played with the four arrow keys to make Willy the 
          Worm run left and right and climb ladders up  and  down,  and 
          the spacebar to make him jump. (Note that when jumping, Willy 
          can change directions  in  mid-air.  This  can  be  extremely 
          useful!)  Any  other  key  makes  him  stop.  On  the  PC,  a 
          convenient stop key is the '5' on the numeric keypad  and  on 
          the  PCjr  DEL  works  well.  To exit to DOS during the game, 
          please use ESC rather than  CTRL-C  because  this  will  save 
          changes to the high score list before leaving.  

          If  you  find  this  game  too  hard (or too easy),  read the 
          EDWILLY.DOC file and use the screen editor to  make  it  suit 
          your fancy.  You can also use the editor to get a preview and 
          practice on the higher levels.  


          Scoring:

          The  bonus  counter is displayed at the bottom of the screen.  
          It starts at 1000 and counts down by tens.  When you finish a 
          level,  the remaining bonus is added to your  score.  If  the 
          bonus  gets  to 0,  you lose a worm and start the level over.  
          Jumping over one or more balls earns  20  points.  Getting  a 
          present  is 100 points.  After the game,  the high scores are 
          displayed in two lists.  The  'Daily  Pinworms'  list  resets 
          each  time  you  enter  the  program,   while  the  'All-Time 
          Nightcrawlers' list is saved on disk.  


          Making DONATIONS:

          You've heard it all before: "The development of this software 
          has taken much time and effort.  If we are  to  continue  our 
          production of user-supported software, your contributions are 
          vital."  Well,  I can tell you first-hand that it's true.  If 
          enough people send ten dollars,  maybe I'll  find  it  in  my 
          heart to write "Willy The Worm II" or "Pete the Pigeon".  

          Hint: If you like this game a LOT, you can send more than ten 
          dollars!
          
          Have gobs of fun and don't forget to pass copies on to all of
          your friends!
